        <h2>The Sound and the Fury</h2>
        <p>
            The Sound and the Fury is a novel by the American author William Faulkner. It employs several narrative styles, including stream of consciousness. Published in 1929, The Sound and the Fury was Faulkner's fourth novel, and was not immediately successful. In 1931, however, when Faulkner's sixth novel, Sanctuary, was published—a sensationalist story, which Faulkner later said was written only for money — The Sound and the Fury also became commercially successful, and Faulkner began to receive critical attention.
